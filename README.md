## Description

It's a site for tourists of Seattle with a main page, where you see only a bunch of photos of different tourists attrations. You can roll it (like a grand spinning wheel) in different ways (swipe on mobile?) depending on your platform and get a random photo. If it's something interesting - the user can click on it and get the more visual and text info about the place with a link to (or an actual) google maps. Another functionality is to let user keep and her notes about the place.
