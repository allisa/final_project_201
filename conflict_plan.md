* What will your group do when it encounters conflict?
    * We plan to have processes in place to help us avoid conflict as far as code goes.
    * If there is shared code, the people who are working on that shared piece together, perhaps in a paired programming set-up.
    * Encourage open communication and remember that everyone does things in their own way.
    * Be clear on when pull requests and merges are made. Be clear with comments and commit messages. Also put username in front of branches.
* How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
    * Clear communication on what each person’s expectations are for what they are working on and when they need to have that piece ready.
    * Making sure we are checking in with each other to help if needed.
    * Have empathy and be kind.
* What is your process to resolve conflicts?
    * Be calm, actively listen, and walk away if needed.
    * Have plans setup to help avoid conflict. Setting up standardize guides for our code, talking through changes that need to be made. 
    * Stopping to listen to your team before jumping to conflict.
* How and when will you escalate the conflict if your attempts are unsuccessful?
    * When you can’t solve it within 15 minutes, talk to a TA or instructor. Don’t gossip.
