## Description

It's a site for tourists of Seattle with a main page, where you see a bunch of photos of different tourists attrations. The user will click through the carousel of images and when they find a location they would like to visit, they will click to get more information. This will take the user to a second page where there will be more images and info on the location. This area will also allow them to takes notes/journal about the location they clicked on. These notes will persist with each visit the user makes to the app.
